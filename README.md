### 🚀 About Me

I am a highly accomplished and results-driven Senior DevOps and Cloud Consultant with over 3 years of hands-on experience in architecting, implementing, and optimizing mission-critical cloud infrastructure. My expertise spans across the leading cloud providers: **AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure**.

My passion lies in transforming complex operational challenges into streamlined, automated, and highly resilient systems. I thrive on enhancing operational efficiency, ensuring robust scalability, and implementing stringent security measures (including SOC2 compliance) to foster innovation and drive business success. I'm a strategic leader dedicated to building the future of cloud infrastructure.

### ✨ What I Do Best (Key Areas of Impact)

My work focuses on delivering high-impact solutions across several critical domains:

#### ☁️ Cloud Architecture & Migration
* **Designing and executing secure, scalable multi-account AWS/GCP/Azure architectures** that significantly enhance deployment efficiency and operational resilience.
* **Leading extensive Dev/Prod resource migrations** from AWS to GCP using Terraform, ensuring seamless transition and operational continuity.
* **Architecting and deploying robust multi-account AWS infrastructure** specifically tailored for secure and scalable LLM model deployment.

#### 🐳 Kubernetes & Containerization
* **Designing and deploying scalable microservices application architectures** on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including SSL management with `cert-manager` and achieving SOC2 compliance.
* **Creating and managing multiple EKS/GKE/AKS clusters** and related infrastructure using CLI and Terraform.
* **Architecting and deploying microservices-based applications on Kubernetes**, leveraging ArgoCD for GitOps where applicable.
* **Designing and implementing comprehensive Kubernetes monitoring frameworks** with Grafana and Prometheus across platforms.

#### ⚙️ CI/CD & Automation
* **Directing teams in implementing production-grade Terraform modules** (base and implementation) for diverse AWS/Azure/GCP services.
* **Establishing automated CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild for Dev/Prod environments, drastically improving deployment frequency and reliability.
* **Managing and improving weekly blue-green deployments** for zero-downtime releases.

#### 🧠 MLOps & Large Language Models (LLM)
* **Implementing cutting-edge MLOps strategies for LLM integration**, including model quantization (8-bit, 16-bit) and containerization, to optimize resource utilization and inference speed.

#### 📊 Data Engineering & Platform Setup
* **Successfully managing data engineering workload migrations to Databricks on GCP**, encompassing project setup, API enablement, subnet creation, Databricks workspace/cluster/Unity Catalog configuration, storage mounts, and cross-project data access points using Terraform and Atlantis.

#### ✅ Operational Excellence & Security
* **Implementing robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BDR) strategies** with automated backups and disaster recovery procedures.
* **Establishing comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems** for proactive issue resolution and ensuring high availability.
* **Continuously hardening cloud environments**, integrating IDS/IPS solutions, refining WAF rules, and auditing S3 access controls for enhanced security.
* **Actively seeking and implementing cost-saving measures** across cloud services.
